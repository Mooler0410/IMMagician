<b> Synopsis </b><p>
We have developed a system that lets anybody recreate any existing painting into stylized dynamic artwork with art-directed controls for various 
global illumination effects such as reflection, refraction, Fresnel, shadows, and sub-surface scattering. Our system takes in information provided 
primarily through a normal map or a depth map, minimally hand-painted textures, and renders physically plausible illumination with complete style control.
